The final episodes premiere April 13 only on #HBOMax.\n\nIn the mid-season premiere, the Titans - with the exception of Gar - are returned to the place they had vanished, the Temple of Trigon, only to find Sebastian and Mother Mayhem are no longer there. The Titans rush to find them before Sebastian summons Trigon, their pursuit leading them to a mysterious town whose populace is hiding a deep secret. Along the way, the Titans come across a prophecy that may require Kory to make a huge sacrifice to save the world, but Dick's feelings for Kory surface and he refuses to let her die. In the final episodes, the Titans enter into an epic battle to save both Kory and the world. Gar goes on a quest of self-discovery, attempting to find his true purpose and to save his friends. Rachel embraces darker powers while Conner, struggling with his Lex Luthor side, goes his own way to defeat Sebastian. Tim and Bernard\u2019s growing feelings for each other become increasingly difficult to resist, and when Bernard\u2019s life is threatened, Tim finally becomes the hero he has always strived to be.\n\nStream TITANS on HBO Max: https://bit.ly/403v1pr\n\n\nSubscribe To DC: https://bit.ly/3vDk4Ox\n\n#DC #DCComics\n\nConnect with DC Online:\n\nFollow DC on INSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/3XxysUi\n\nLike DC on FACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/3oQVPs2\n\nFollow DC on TWITTER: https://bit.ly/420OU1Z\n\nVisit the DC WEBSITE: https://www.dc.com/\n\nSubscribe to DC UNIVERSE INFINITE: https://bit.ly/3zAJZqX\n\nThe official home of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash and the rest of The World's Greatest Super Heroes!"}, {"Title": "The Suicide Squad - Starro the Conqueror | Super Scenes | DC", "Published_date": "2023-03-18T16:00:35Z", "Views": "90542", "Likes": "1659", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "141", "Description": "The Suicide Squad vs Starro the Conqueror... welcome to the heavyweight fight from hell.\n\nWatch THE SUICIDE SQUAD on Google Play: https://bit.ly/3SQXWKL\n\nStream THE SUICIDE SQUAD on HBO Max: https://bit.ly/3Ja00dq\n\nSubscribe To DC: https://bit.ly/3vDk4Ox \n#DC #DCComics\n\nConnect with DC Online: \nFollow DC on INSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/3XxysUi \nLike DC on FACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/3oQVPs2 \nFollow DC on TWITTER: https://bit.ly/3oTsD3S \nVisit the DC WEBSITE: https://www.dc.com/ \nSubscribe to DC UNIVERSE INFINITE: https://bit.ly/3zAJZqX \nThe official home of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash and the rest of The World's Greatest Super Heroes!"}, {"Title": "Every Transformation In SHAZAM! | DC | #Shorts", "Published_date": "2023-03-13T20:00:01Z", "Views": "323448", "Likes": "22259", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "145", "Description": "Just say the magic word.

When a supernatural event shakes her hometown of Port Oswego to the core, Naomi sets out to uncover its origins, with a little help from her fiercely loyal best friend Annabelle (Mary-Charles Jones, \u201cKevin Can Wait\u201d). She also has the support of her adoptive, doting parents, veteran military officer Greg (Barry Watson, \u201c7th Heaven,\u201d \u201cThe Loudest Voice\u201d) and linguistics teacher Jennifer (Mouzam Makkar, \u201cThe Fix\u201d). After an encounter with Zumbado (Cranston Johnson, \u201cFilthy Rich\u201d), the mysterious owner of a used car lot, leaves her shaken, Naomi turns to tattoo parlor owner Dee (Alexander Wraith, \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d), who becomes her reluctant mentor. While unfolding the mystery about herself, Naomi also effortlessly navigates her high school friendships with kids on the military base as well as well as local townies, including ex-boyfriend and high school jock Nathan (Daniel Puig); Annabelle\u2019s longtime, loyal boyfriend Jacob (Aidan Gemme); proud \u201ctownie\u201d Anthony (Will Meyers, \u201cBad Education\u201d); and fellow comic book enthusiast Lourdes (Camila Moreno), who works in a vintage collectible shop. As Naomi journeys to the heights of the Multiverse in search of answers, what she discovers will challenge everything we believe about our heroes. Based on the characters from DC, NAOMI is written and executive produced by Ava DuVernay and Jill Blankenship (\u201cArrow\u201d), and executive produced by Sarah Bremner and Paul Garnes of ARRAY Filmworks. Amanda Marsalis (\u201cEcho Park,\u201d \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d) directed and co-executive produced the pilot episode. The series is from ARRAY Filmworks in association with Warner Bros.

Home Entertainment history, come to animated life in DC Showcase - Batman: Death in the Family. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation and DC, the anthology of 2019-2020 animated shorts arrives from WBHE on Blu-ray and Digital in Fall 2020.\n\nAnchoring the compilation of shorts is Batman: Death in the Family, WBHE's first-ever venture into interactive storytelling that allows fans to choose where the story goes through an innovative navigation guided by the viewer's remote control. Central to the extended-length short is an adaptation of \"Batman: A Death in the Family,\" the 1988 landmark DC event where fans voted by telephone to determine the story's ending.\n\nThe interactive Blu-ray presentation offers many different ways for viewers to tell the Batman: Death in the Family story, with numerous twists and turns in the middle, and several possible endings. The choices along the way put greater weight on the viewers' decisions and result in even stronger stories.\n\nProduced, directed and written by Brandon Vietti, Batman: Death in the Family offers an inventive take on the long-demanded story. In the new animated presentation, the infamous murder of Batman prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Jason Todd will be undone, and the destinies of Batman, Robin and The Joker will play out in shocking new ways as viewers make multiple choices to control the story. And while Batman: Under the Red Hood provides a baseline, the story also branches in new directions and features several characters previously unseen in the original film.\n\nBruce Greenwood (The Resident, Star Trek, iRobot), Vincent Martella (Phineas and Ferb) and John DiMaggio (Futurama, Adventure Time) reprise their Batman: Under The Red Hood roles of Batman, young Jason Todd and The Joker, respectively. Other featured voices are Zehra Fazal (Young Justice) as Talia al Ghul and Gary Cole (Veep) as Two-Face and James Gordon.\n#DC #DCComics #DCUniverse"}, {"Title": "DC's Creative Talent is Going Behind the Scenes! | Comic Con 2020", "Published_date": "2020-07-25T22:00:05Z", "Views": "9989", "Likes": "540", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "69", "Description": "Be sure to drop in on this panel to hear from DC\u2019s hottest talent about their latest works and how they\u2019re making DC and The World\u2019s Greatest Super Heroes the home for fans of great superhero storytelling worldwide!The creative talent behind some of DC\u2019s most popular characters are on hand to give behind the scenes details on their stories and how they put their own unique voices to the heroes and villains that DC fans have come to know and love (and hate)!\n\nSegments covering Batman Joker War, Dark Knights: Death Metal, and DC Black Label.\n\nTalent: Greg Capullo, Cecil Castellucci, Katana Collins, Kami Garcia, Jorge Jimenez, Darren Warren Johnson, Dan Jurgens, Jim Lee, Sean Gordon Murphy, Bruno Redondo, Scott Snyder, James Tynion IV, and Brad Walker.\n#DC #DCComics #DCUniverse"}, {"Title": "What's in Store for Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman? | Comic Con 2020", "Published_date": "2020-07-24T21:22:46Z", "Views": "19451", "Likes": "1027", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "97", "Description": "Whether it's Batman\u2019s final showdown with The Joker, Wonder Woman taking on new adventures, or the Man of Steel taking facing threats from Metropolis and across the cosmos, DC is the place to be for the best storytellers lending their talents to the World\u2019s Greatest Super Heroes!

At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the New York Times best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that The Sandman originally re-defined the graphic novel. \n\nWhen The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three \u201ctools\u201d that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more. \n\nA powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you\u2019ve never heard anything like this.\n#DC #DCComics #DCUniverse"}, {"Title": "The Search for Paol\u00ed | The Last God RPG | Episode 2", "Published_date": "2020-07-05T20:00:00Z", "Views": "12100", "Likes": "357", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "24", "Description": "Finding the scribe Paol\u00ed is the only hope the party has to find where the evil villian has taken Julie!\n\n\"The Adventure Continues\" - featuring content from The Last God Sourcebook in this three part special tabletop roleplaying game.\n\nIn Phillip Kennedy Johnson and Riccardo Federici\u2019s The Last God, the city of Cain Anuun serves as a rich and layered backdrop to a story of fantasy, adventure and horror.

Before they became Batman, Catwoman, and The Joker, Bruce, Selina, and Jack were high schoolers who would do whatever it took--even destroy the ones they love--to satisfy their own motives.\n\nAfter being kicked out of his boarding school, 16-year-old Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham City to find that nothing is as he left it. What once was his family home is now an empty husk, lonely but haunted by the memory of his parents' murder. Selina Kyle, once the innocent girl next door, now rules over Gotham High School with a dangerous flair, aided by the class clown, Jack Napier.\n\nWhen a kidnapping rattles the school, Bruce seeks answers as the dark and troubled knight--but is he actually the pawn? Nothing is ever as it seems, especially at Gotham High, where the parties and romances are of the highest stakes ... and where everyone is a suspect.\n\nWith enchanting art by Thomas Pitilli, this new graphic novel is just as intoxicating as it is chilling, in which dearest friends turn into greatest enemies--all within the hallways of Gotham High!\n\nhttps://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/gotham-high\n#DC #DCComics #DCUniverse"}, {"Title": "New Joker Comic, Batman: Death in the Family, + More!", "Published_date": "2020-03-27T00:22:39Z", "Views": "27521", "Likes": "877", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "130", "Description": "Joker: The Deluxe Edition by Brian Azzarello and Lee Bermejo is getting a hardcover re-release!

Literally every other person on the island is an adult proficient in their trade and mighty in body, while she is gangly, sometimes clumsy, and not particularly proficient in  anything. She's not  Wonder Woman yet. What Diana needs is a friend; someone her own age whom she can talk to. But when she decides to take matters into her own hands--she may just make a monster instead.\n\nhttps://www.dccomics.com/graphic-novels/diana-princess-of-the-amazons\n\nDiana Princess of the Amazons | Official Trailer\n#DC #DCComics #DCUniverse"}, {"Title": "Mark Hamill on Playing the Joker + Other Comic Book News | TOP 5 HEADLINES", "Published_date": "2019-12-18T23:30:00Z", "Views": "21422", "Likes": "989", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "60", "Description": "Don't miss the insider scoop with Mark Hamill from from Batman the Animated Series!

Only totally different. #DCUDoomPatrol series premiere on February 15, only on #DCUNIVERSE.\n\nDOOM PATROL reimagines one of DC\u2019s most beloved groups of Super Heroes:  Robotman aka Cliff Steele (BRENDAN FRASER), Negative Man aka Larry Trainor (MATT BOMER), Elasti-Woman aka Rita Farr (APRIL BOWLBY) and Crazy Jane (DIANE GUERRERO), led by modern-day mad scientist Niles Caulder aka The Chief (TIMOTHY DALTON).  Each member of the Doom Patrol suffered a horrible accident that gave them superhuman abilities, but also left them scarred and disfigured.  Traumatized and downtrodden, the team found their purpose through The Chief, coming together to investigate the weirdest phenomena in existence.  Following the mysterious disappearance of The Chief these reluctant heroes will find themselves in a place they never expected to be, called to action by none other than Cyborg (JOIVAN WADE), who comes to them with a mission hard to refuse.  Part support group, part Super Hero team, the Doom Patrol is a band of superpowered freaks who fight for a world that wants nothing to do with them.\n\nBased on DC characters originally written and drawn by Arnold Drake, Bob Haney and Bruno Premiani #DCUDOOMPATROL premieres February 15.

The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line! \n\nWill Arnett (\u201cThe LEGO\u00ae Batman Movie\u201d) and Kristen Bell (\u201cFrozen\u201d) lend their voices to the first-ever big-screen version of DC Entertainment and Cartoon Network\u2019s animated TV show, which also stars Greg Cipes (TV\u2019s \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d) as Beast Boy, Scott Menville (TV\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man\u201d) as Robin, Khary Payton (\u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) as Cyborg, Tara Strong (the \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d franchise) as Raven, and Hynden Walch (TV\u2019s \u201cAdventure Time with Finn & Jake\u201d) as Starfire, reprising their roles from the series. \n\nThe film is being directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail, from a screenplay by Michael Jelenic and Horvath, based on characters from DC. Michail, Will Arnett, Jed Weitzman, and Peggy Regan are producing, with Sam Register, Jelenic, and Horvath serving as executive producers.

The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line! \n\nWill Arnett (\u201cThe LEGO\u00ae Batman Movie\u201d) and Kristen Bell (\u201cFrozen\u201d) lend their voices to the first-ever big-screen version of DC Entertainment and Cartoon Network\u2019s animated TV show, which also stars Greg Cipes (TV\u2019s \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d) as Beast Boy, Scott Menville (TV\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man\u201d) as Robin, Khary Payton (\u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) as Cyborg, Tara Strong (the \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d franchise) as Raven, and Hynden Walch (TV\u2019s \u201cAdventure Time with Finn & Jake\u201d) as Starfire, reprising their roles from the series. \n\nThe film is being directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail, from a screenplay by Michael Jelenic and Horvath, based on characters from DC.
