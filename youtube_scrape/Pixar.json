The trailer showcases each element\u2014air, earth, water and fire\u2014and what sets them apart according to Ember, a quick-witted and fiery woman who\u2019s always stayed close to home in Firetown. In \u201cElemental,\u201d which opens in theaters on June 16, she finally ventures out of her comfort zone to explore this spectacular world born from the imaginations of Pixar\u2019s filmmakers and specifically crafted for the big-screen experience. Element City is inspired by big cities around the globe and embraces theorized contributions from each elemental community\u2014from giant pine-tree-like buildings and waterfall skyscrapers to a tornado-shaped arena called Cyclone Stadium. \n\nJoining the previously announced voice cast including Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as Ember and Wade, respectively, are Ronnie del Carmen as Ember\u2019s soon-to-be retired dad, Bernie; Shila Ommi as Ember\u2019s love-seeking mom, Cinder; Wendi McLendon-Covey as Wade\u2019s stormy and Air-Ball-loving boss, Gale; Catherine O\u2019Hara as Wade\u2019s welcoming mom, Brook; Mason Wertheimer as Ember\u2019s admiring earth neighbor, Clod; and Joe Pera as an overgrown city bureaucrat, Fern.\n \nDirected by Peter Sohn, produced by Denise Ream, p.g.a., and executive produced by Pete Docter, \u201cElemental\u201d features a screenplay by John Hoberg & Kat Likkel and Brenda Hsueh with story by Sohn, Hoberg & Likkel and Hsueh.

(April 1, 2016) - Disney\u2022Pixar\u2019s \u201cFinding Dory\u201d filmmakers revealed today that Hank, the film\u2019s cantankerous octopus with camouflaging capabilities, has appeared in every one of their feature films since 1995\u2019s \u201cToy Story.\u201d \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d featuring the voice of Ed O\u2019Neill as Hank, opens in theaters nationwide on June 17, 2016.\n\n\u201cEvery Pixar fan knows that we love Easter Eggs,\u201d said director Andrew Stanton, who also directed the 2003 Oscar\u00ae-winning film \u201cFinding Nemo.\u201d \u201cAnd until now, Hank has been our most closely guarded secret. There are even people internally at Pixar who don\u2019t know about this.\u201d\n\nPixar is known for the hidden gems that appear in its feature films, including the Luxo Ball, the Pizza Planet Truck and A113, which is a nod to the animation classroom at CalArts, where several filmmakers attended. But the octopus\u2014who\u2019s actually a \u201cseptopus,\u201d as he\u2019s missing a tentacle\u2014has remained a secret for two decades. \u201cHank started off as a bit of an inside joke between those of us who were here at Pixar in the very beginning,\u201c said Stanton. \u201cBut since then, finding a place for him in our films has become part of our culture, and I\u2019m glad we finally get to introduce him properly to fans.\u201d\n\nThe studio released a short video featuring Stanton and O\u2019Neill, showcasing several of Hank\u2019s cameos throughout the years and even providing a new glimpse of the character in action in \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d\n\n\nABOUT \u201cFINDING DORY\u201d\nDisney\u2022Pixar's \u201cFinding Dory\u201d welcomes back to the big screen everyone\u2019s favorite forgetful blue tang Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who\u2019s living happily in the reef with Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) and Nemo (voice of Hayden Rolence). When Dory suddenly remembers that she has a family out there who may be looking for her, the trio takes off on a life-changing adventure across the ocean to California\u2019s prestigious Marine Life Institute, a\u00a0rehabilitation center and aquarium. In an effort to find her mom (voice of Diane Keaton) and dad (voice of Eugene Levy), Dory enlists the help of three of the MLI\u2019s most intriguing residents: Hank (voice of Ed O\u2019Neill), a cantankerous octopus who frequently gives employees the slip; Bailey (voice of Ty Burrell), a beluga whale who is convinced his biological sonar skills are on the fritz; and Destiny (voice of Kaitlin Olson), a nearsighted whale shark. Deftly navigating the complex inner workings of the MLI, Dory and her friends discover the magic within their flaws, friendships and family.\n\u00a0\nDirected by Andrew Stanton (\u201cFinding Nemo,\u201d \u201cWALL\u2022E\u201d), co-directed by Angus MacLane (\u201cToy Story OF TERROR!\u201d), and produced by Lindsey Collins (co-producer \u201cWALL\u2022E\u201d), Disney\u2022Pixar's\u00a0 \u201cFinding Dory\u201d swims into theaters June 17, 2016.

So pals Mike and Sulley plot to rectify the mistake and return Boo to her home.

Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land: massive Lord MacGuffin, surly Lord Macintosh and cantankerous Lord Dingwall. Merida's actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, and when she turns to an eccentric old Witch for help, she is granted an ill-fated wish. The ensuing peril forces Merida to discover the meaning of true bravery in order to undo a beastly curse before it's too late."}, {"Title": "Cars 2: Japan Fast Dirt Section - Clip", "Published_date": "2011-06-17T18:46:09Z", "Views": "3754209", "Likes": "2851", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "0", "Description": "Streaming Now on Disney+ \u2013 Sign Up at https://disneyplus.com/\n\nOrder here: http://di.sn/F5\n\nNow available on Blu-ray\u2122 Combo Pack, Blu-ray\u2122 3D, DVD and Movie Download\n\nBecome a fan of Cars on Facebook: http://facebook.com/PixarCars\n\nOfficial Cars 2 Website: http://disney.com/Cars"}, {"Title": "Cars 2: Wasabi -
