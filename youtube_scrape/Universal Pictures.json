The way in which it captures a time, a place, and above all, a mood, makes this film a masterpiece. The setting is a dusty Southern town during the Depression. A white woman accuses a black man of rape. Though he is obviously innocent, the outcome of his trial is such a foregone conclusion that no lawyer will step forward to defend him \u2013 except Peck, the town's most distinguished citizen. His compassionate defense costs him many friendships but earns him the respect and admiration of his two motherless children.\n\n\u00a9 1963 Pakula-Mulligan Productions, Inc. & Brentwood Productions, Inc.

Filmmaker Nia DaCosta (Little Woods, next year\u2019s The Marvels) directs this contemporary incarnation of the cult classic.  \n\nFor as long as residents can remember, the housing projects of Chicago\u2019s Cabrini-Green neighborhood were terrorized by a word-of-mouth ghost story about a supernatural killer with a hook for a hand, easily summoned by those daring to repeat his name five times into a mirror. In present day, a decade after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, visual artist Anthony McCoy (Emmy winner Yahya Abdul-Mateen II; Watchmen, Us) and his partner, gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris; If Beale Street Could Talk, WandaVision), move into a luxury loft condo in Cabrini, now gentrified beyond recognition and inhabited by upwardly mobile millennials.\n\nWith Anthony\u2019s painting career on the brink of stalling, a chance encounter with a Cabrini-Green old-timer (COLMAN DOMINGO; Zola, Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom) exposes Anthony to the horrific true story behind Candyman. Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, and spurred on by his white art dealer, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh inspiration for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifying wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny.\n\nUniversal Pictures presents, from Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures and Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld\u2019s Monkeypaw Productions, in association with BRON Creative, Candyman.

Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss (Us, Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale) stars in a terrifying modern tale of obsession inspired by Universal's classic monster character. Trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with a wealthy and brilliant scientist, Cecilia Kass (Moss) escapes in the dead of night and disappears into hiding, aided by her sister (Harriet Dyer, NBC's The InBetween), their childhood friend (Aldis Hodge, Straight Outta Compton) and his teenage daughter (Storm Reid, HBO's Euphoria). But when Cecilia's abusive ex (Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House) commits suicide and leaves her a generous portion of his vast fortune, Cecilia suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of eerie coincidences turns lethal, threatening the lives of those she loves, Cecilia's sanity begins to unravel as she desperately tries to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Universal Studios.

So, the first prehistoric family sets off into the world in search of a safer place to call home.

Over the past few weeks, our film family has looked at the forecast of theatrical exhibition with obvious concern. We have discussed and struggled with how best to present \u201cHalloween Kills\u201d to the loyal fans around the world, as well as the new audience we hope to invite to this experience. \n\n\n\nIt was a wild and vibrant production. We lined up a cast of legacy characters like Laurie and Tommy, Lindsey, Lonnie, Marion, Brackett and The Shape, then alongside some new faces, we aggressively made the second chapter of our \u201cHalloween\u201d trilogy. It unfolded into an experience that was a creative playground and we feel confident that our misfit pleasures will be seen as an unexpected entry into this franchise. \n\n\n\nIf we release it in October of this year as planned, we have to face the reality that the film would be consumed in a compromised theatrical experience. After weighing our options, we have chosen to push the film\u2019s theatrical release by one year. \n\n\n\nOn top of a traditional release, Universal has agreed to an IMAX presentation of the film in October 2021. We are sound mixing with one of the greatest design teams that can slash, scream and creep their way under your skin.

As Marcus' devious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death. \n\n\u00a9 2000 DreamWorks LLC and Universal Studios.

Call him laugh-out-loud funny. But whatever you do call him Bean. In the comedy that rocked America, Rowan Atkinson is the outrageous Mr. Bean, sent on a mission to California to escort the world famous painting of \"Whistler's Mother\" to its new home in The Grierson Gallery. What the gallery owner, one of the richest men in America, and his curator David Langley (Peter MacNicol) believe, is that Mr. Bean is Dr. Bean, a renowned art expert. In fact he is just a sleepy-headed, wildly eccentric museum guard. He's also the clumsiest, craziest, wackiest, wildest, most bizarre character they have ever come across, and certainly not someone you'd entrust one of the world's most valuable paintings to. But they have - and now wreaking havoc in the Grierson Gallery and wrecking Langley's marriage is just the beginning. With only hours to go before the official unveiling by the museum's benefactor, General Newton (Burt Reynolds), something terrible has happened to \"Whistler's Mother\" and only one man has the power to put it right.

The situation escalates, with sudden and  tragic results, when the man kills the police officer in self-defense. Terrified and in fear for their lives, the man, a retail employee, and the woman, a criminal defense lawyer, are forced to go on the run. But the incident is captured on video and goes viral, and the couple unwittingly become a symbol of trauma, terror, grief and pain for people across the country. \n\nAs they drive, these two unlikely fugitives will discover themselves and each other in the most dire and desperate of circumstances, and will forge a deep and powerful love that will reveal their shared humanity and shape the rest of their lives. \n\nJoining a legacy of films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Thelma & Louise, Queen & Slim is a powerful, consciousness-raising love story that confronts the staggering human toll of racism and the life-shattering price of violence.\n\nWaithe wrote the script based on an original idea by bestselling author James Frey (A Million Little Pieces, Katerina). The feature-film directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas (executive producer of HBO\u2019s Insecure) stars Academy Award\u00ae nominee Daniel Kaluuya as \u201cSlim\u201d and rising star Jodie Turner-Smith (Syfy\u2019s Nightflyers), as \u201cQueen.\u201d\n \nWaithe produces the film via her company, Hillman Grad Productions, along with Matsoukas via her production company, De La Revoluci\u00f3n Films.
