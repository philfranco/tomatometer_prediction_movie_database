Starring Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield.  Only in theaters 2021.  \u201cYou can murder a revolutionary, but you can\u2019t murder a revolution.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/wbpictures\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wbpictures \nhttps://www.facebook.com/WarnerBrosPictures/\n\nChairman Fred Hampton was 21 years old when he was assassinated by the FBI, who coerced a petty criminal named William O\u2019Neal to help them silence him and the Black Panther Party.  But they could not kill Fred Hampton\u2019s legacy and, 50 years later, his words still echo\u2026louder than ever. \n\nI am a revolutionary!\n         \nIn 1968, a young, charismatic activist named Fred Hampton became Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, who were fighting for freedom, the power to determine the destiny of the Black community, and an end to police brutality and the slaughter of Black people.\n\nChairman Fred was inspiring a generation to rise up and not back down to oppression, which put him directly in the line of fire of the government, the FBI and the Chicago Police.  But to destroy the revolution, they had to do it from both the outside\u2026and the inside.  Facing prison, William O\u2019Neal is offered a deal by the FBI: if he will infiltrate the Black Panthers and provide intel on Hampton, he will walk free.  O\u2019Neal takes the deal.\n         \nNow a comrade in arms in the Black Panther Party, O\u2019Neal lives in fear that his treachery will be discovered even as he rises in the ranks.  But as Hampton\u2019s fiery message draws him in, O\u2019Neal cannot escape the deadly trajectory of his ultimate betrayal.\n         \nThough his life was cut short, Fred Hampton\u2019s impact has continued to reverberate.  The government saw the Black Panthers as a militant threat to the status quo and sold that lie to a frightened public in a time of growing civil unrest.  But the perception of the Panthers was not reality.  In inner cities across America, they were providing free breakfasts for children, legal services, medical clinics and research into sickle cell anemia, and political education.  And it was Chairman Fred in Chicago, who, recognizing the power of multicultural unity for a common cause, created the Rainbow Coalition\u2014joining forces with other oppressed peoples in the city to fight for equality and political empowerment.\n\n\u201cJudas and the Black Messiah\u201d stars Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya (\u201cGet Out,\u201d \u201cWidows,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther\u201d) as Fred Hampton and LaKeith Stanfield (\u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web\u201d) as William O\u2019Neal.

The project originated with King and his writing partner, Will Berson, who co-wrote the screenplay, and Kenny Lucas & Keith Lucas, who co-wrote the story with Berson & King.  King, who has a long relationship with filmmaker Ryan Coogler (\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cCreed,\u201d \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d), pitched the film to Coogler and Charles D.

After graduating from Harvard, Bryan had his pick of lucrative jobs.  Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemned or who were not afforded proper representation, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley (Larson).  One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in 1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite a preponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony against him came from a criminal with a motive to lie.  In the years that follow, Bryan becomes embroiled in a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt and unabashed racism as he fights for Walter, and others like him, with the odds\u2014and the system\u2014stacked against them. \nThe main cast also includes Rob Morgan (\u201cMudbound\u201d) as Herbert Richardson, a fellow prisoner who also sits on death row awaiting his fate; Tim Blake Nelson (\u201cWormwood\u201d) as Ralph Myers, whose pivotal testimony against Walter McMillian is called into question; Rafe Spall as Tommy Chapman, the DA who is fighting to uphold Walter\u2019s conviction and sentence; and O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. (\u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d) as Anthony Ray Hinton, another wrongly convicted death row inmate whose cause is taken up by Bryan. \nThe film is produced by two-time Oscar nominee Gil Netter (\u201cLife of Pi,\u201d \u201cThe Blind Side\u201d), Asher Goldstein (\u201cShort Term 12\u201d) and Michael B. Jordan.  Bryan Stevenson, Mike Drake, Niija Kuykendall, Gabriel Hammond, Daniel Hammond, Scott Budnick, Jeff Skoll and Charles D. King served as executive producers. \nCretton co-wrote the screenplay with Andrew Lanham (\u201cThe Glass Castle\u201d), based on Stevenson\u2019s book Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption.  Published in 2014 by Spiegel & Grau, the book has spent more than 150 weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers List, and counting.  It was also named one of the year\u2019s best books by a number of top publications, including TIME Magazine.  For the book, Stevenson also won the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence, an NAACP Image Award, and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for Nonfiction. \nCretton\u2019s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Brett Pawlak, production designer Sharon Seymour, editor Nat Sanders and composer Joel P. West, all of whom previously collaborated with the director on \u201cThe Glass Castle.\u201d  They are joined by costume designer Francine Jamison-Tanchuck (\u201cDetroit,\u201d \u201cRoman J.

After graduating from Harvard, Bryan had his pick of lucrative jobs.  Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemned or who were not afforded proper representation, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley (Larson).  One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in 1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite a preponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony against him came from a criminal with a motive to lie.

Published in 2014 by Spiegel & Grau, the book has spent more than 150 weeks on The New York Times Best Sellers List, and counting.  It was also named one of the year\u2019s best books by a number of top publications, including TIME Magazine.

The Weeping Woman.  A horrifying apparition, caught between Heaven and Hell, trapped in a terrible fate sealed by her own hand.  The mere mention of her name has struck terror around the world for generations. \n\nIn life, she drowned her children in a jealous rage, throwing herself in the churning river after them as she wept in pain.  \n\nNow her tears are eternal. They are lethal, and those who hear her death call in the night are doomed. La Llorona creeps in the shadows and preys on the children, desperate to replace her own. As the centuries have passed, her desire has grown more voracious ... and her methods more terrifying.\n\nIn 1970s Los Angeles, La Llorona is stalking the night\u2014and the children. \n\nIgnoring the eerie warning of a troubled mother suspected of child endangerment, a social worker and her own small kids are soon drawn into a frightening supernatural realm. Their only hope to survive La Llorona\u2019s deadly wrath may be a disillusioned priest and the mysticism he practices to keep evil at bay, on the fringes where fear and faith collide.  \n\nBeware of her chilling wail\u2026she will stop at nothing to lure you into the gloom.  \n\nBecause there is no peace for her anguish. There is no mercy for her soul. \n\nAnd there is no escape from the curse of La Llorona.\n \nOn April 19, 2019, this timeless Mexican legend comes to terrifying life in New Line Cinema\u2019s \u201cThe Curse of La Llorona.\u201d\n\nThe film is produced by Emile Gladstone, Gary Dauberman (\u201cIT\u201d and \u201cAnnabelle\u201d franchises) and James Wan (\u201cThe Conjuring\u201d universe).

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).

Taking fatherly advice is not in Joe Coughlin\u2019s nature.  Instead, the WWI vet is a self-proclaimed anti-establishment outlaw, despite being the son of the Boston Police Deputy Superintendent.  Joe\u2019s not all bad, though; in fact, he\u2019s not really bad enough for the life he\u2019s chosen.  Unlike the gangsters he refuses to work for, he has a sense of justice and an open heart, and both work against him, leaving him vulnerable time and again\u2014in business and in love.  Driven by a need to right the wrongs committed against him and those close to him, Joe heads down a risky path that goes against his upbringing and his own moral code.  Leaving the cold Boston winter behind, he and his reckless crew turn up the heat in Tampa.  And while revenge may taste sweeter than the molasses that infuses every drop of illegal rum he runs, Joe will learn that it comes at a price.\n\n\u201cLive by Night\u201d is produced by Leonardo DiCaprio (\u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d \u201cOut of the Furnace\u201d) and Jennifer Davisson (\u201cThe Ides of March,\u201d \u201cOrphan\u201d), under the Appian Way banner; and Ben Affleck and Jennifer Todd (\u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d) for Pearl Street Films.

Over the next 69 days, an international team worked night and day in a desperate attempt to rescue the trapped men as their families and friends, as well as millions of people globally, waited and watched anxiously for any sign of hope. But 200 stories beneath the surface, in the suffocating heat and with tensions rising, provisions\u2014and time\u2014were quickly running out.\n\nA story of resilience, personal transformation and triumph of the human spirit, the film takes us to the Earth\u2019s darkest depths, revealing the psyches of the men trapped in the mine, and depicting the courage of both the miners and their families who refused to give up.\n\nBased on the gripping true story of survival\u2014and filmed with the cooperation of the miners, their families and their rescuers\u2014\u201cThe 33\u201d reveals the never-before-seen actual events that unfolded, above and below ground, which became nothing less than a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nThe international cast is led by Antonio Banderas, Rodrigo Santoro, Academy Award winner Juliette Binoche (\u201cThe English Patient\u201d), James Brolin, and Lou Diamond Phillips, with Bob Gunton and Gabriel Byrne.

Despite his insistence that he is out of the fight game for good, Rocky sees in Adonis the strength and determination he had known in Apollo\u2014the fierce rival who became his closest friend.

What he does find is a 50-foot giant with an insatiable appetite for metal and a childlike curiosity about its new world.  \n\nRumors of everything from an alien invasion to a Russian secret weapon bent on destroying Rockwell soon spread through the small town, prompting the arrival of government agent Kent Mansley (voiced by Christopher McDonald).  Keeping one step ahead of Mansley, Hogarth convinces his beatnik friend Dean (voiced by Harry Connick, Jr.) to hide the Iron Giant (voiced by Vin Diesel) in Dean\u2019s junkyard.  \n\nBut it isn\u2019t long before the rumors turn into paranoia\u2014the situation escalates and the possible destruction of Rockwell looms.  Hogarth turns to his friend, the Iron Giant, who ultimately finds its humanity by unselfishly saving the town\u2019s residents from their own fears and prejudices. \n\nIn times like these, you really find out what your friends are made of\u2026sometimes, it\u2019s even metal.\n\nWarner Bros. presents \u201cThe Iron Giant,\u201d a full-length animated motion picture directed by Brad Bird.

Pictures and New Line Cinema comes award-winning filmmaker Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cCreed.\u201d  The film explores a new chapter in the \u201cRocky\u201d story and stars Academy Award nominee Sylvester Stallone in his iconic role.  The film also reunites Coogler with his \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d star Michael B. Jordan as the son of Apollo Creed.\n\nAdonis Johnson (Jordan) never knew his famous father, world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, who died before he was born.  Still, there\u2019s no denying that boxing is in his blood, so Adonis heads to Philadelphia, the site of Apollo Creed\u2019s legendary match with a tough upstart named Rocky Balboa.\n\nOnce in the City of Brotherly Love, Adonis tracks Rocky (Stallone) down and asks him to be his trainer.  Despite his insistence that he is out of the fight game for good, Rocky sees in Adonis the strength and determination he had known in Apollo\u2014the fierce rival who became his closest friend.  Agreeing to take him on, Rocky trains the young fighter, even as the former champ is battling an opponent more deadly than any he faced in the ring. \n\nWith Rocky in his corner, it isn\u2019t long before Adonis gets his own shot at the title\u2026but can he develop not only the drive but also the heart of a true fighter, in time to get into the ring?\n\n\u201cCreed\u201d also stars Tessa Thompson (\u201cSelma,\u201d \u201cDear White People\u201d) as Bianca, a local singer-songwriter who becomes involved with Adonis; Phylicia Rashad (Lifetime\u2019s \u201cSteel Magnolias\u201d) as Mary Anne Creed, Apollo\u2019s widow; and English pro boxer and former three-time ABA Heavyweight Champion Anthony Bellew as boxing champ \u201cPretty\u201d Ricky Conlan.\n\nCoogler directs from a screenplay he wrote with Aaron Covington, based on characters from the \u201cRocky\u201d series written by Sylvester Stallone.  The film is being produced by Robert Chartoff, Irwin Winkler, Charles Winkler, William Chartoff, David Winkler, Kevin King Templeton and Sylvester Stallone, with Nicholas Stern executive producing.\n\nJoining Coogler behind the scenes are director of photography Maryse Alberti (\u201cThe Wrestler\u201d) and costume designers Antoinette Messam (\u201cOrphan\u201d) and Emma Potts (\u201c127 Hours\u201d), as well as his \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d team: editors Michael P.

Enraged, Smaug rains his fiery wrath down upon the defenseless men, women and children of Lake-town.  \n\nObsessed above all else with his reclaimed treasure, Thorin sacrifices friendship and honor to hoard it as Bilbo\u2019s frantic attempts to make him see reason drive the Hobbit towards a desperate and dangerous choice.  But there are even greater dangers ahead.  Unseen by any but the Wizard Gandalf, the great enemy Sauron has sent forth legions of Orcs in a stealth attack upon the Lonely Mountain.  \n\nAs darkness converges on their escalating conflict, the races of Dwarves, Elves and Men must decide \u2013 unite or be destroyed.  Bilbo finds himself fighting for his life and the lives of his friends in the epic Battle of the Five Armies, as the future of Middle-earth hangs in the balance.\n\nFollow us on:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheHobbitMovie\nhttps://twitter.com/thehobbitmovie\nhttp://instagram.com/thehobbitmovie\n\nPre-order the soundtrack:\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Hobbit3_i \nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/hobbit3sp_az"}, {"Title": "Pan - Official Teaser Trailer [HD]", "Published_date": "2014-11-25T17:00:03Z", "Views": "13804373", "Likes": "48949", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "5430", "Description": "Hugh Jackman, Garrett Hedlund, Rooney Mara and Levi Miller star in PAN, in theaters October 9th!\nhttp://www.pan-movie.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PanOfficial\n\nFrom Warner Bros.

Fifteen years later, a humanitarian effort would bring 3600 lost boys and girls to America.\n\nIn \"The Good Lie,\" Philippe Falardeau, (writer and director of the Oscar\u00ae- nominated Foreign Language film \"Monsieur Lazhar\") brings the story of their survival and triumph to life.   Academy Award\u00ae winner Reese Witherspoon (\"Walk the Line\") stars alongside Sudanese actors Arnold Oceng, Ger Duany, Emmanuel Jal, and newcomer Nyakuoth Weil, many of whom were also children of war. \n\nMamere and Theo are sons of the Chief in their village in Southern Sudan.  When an attack by the Northern militia destroys their home and kills their parents, eldest son Theo is forced to assume the role of Chief and lead a group of young survivors, including his sister Abital, away from harm.  But the hostile, treacherous terrain has other dangers in store for them.  \n\nAs the tattered group makes the difficult trek to Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, they meet other fleeing children, forging a bond with Jeremiah, who, at 13, is already a man of faith, and Paul, whose skills become essential to their survival.  \n\nThirteen years later, the now young adults are given the opportunity to leave the camp and resettle in America.  Upon arriving in Kansas, they are met by Carrie Davis (Witherspoon), an employment agency counselor who has been enlisted to help find them jobs\u2014no easy task, when things like straws, light switches and telephones are brand new to them.  \n\nAlthough Carrie has successfully kept herself from any emotional entanglements, these refugees, who desperately require help navigating the 20th century and rebuilding their shattered lives, need just that.   So Carrie embarks on her own unchartered territory, enlisting the help of her boss, Jack (Corey Stoll). \n\nTogether, against the backdrop of their shared losses, the Lost Boys and these unlikely strangers find humor in the clash of cultures, and heartbreak as well as hope in the challenges of life in America.  \n\nAlong with Witherspoon, the film stars Corey Stoll (TV's \"House of Cards\"); real-life Sudanese refugees Arnold Oceng (BBC's \"Grange Hill\") and newcomer Nyakuoth Wiel; Ger Duany (\"I Heart Huckabees\") and rapper Emmanuel Jal, who were both former child soldiers and lost boys; and Femi Oguns (BBC's \"The Casualty\").  Rounding out the cast are Sarah Baker as volunteer Pamela Lowi; Mike Pniewski as Mamere's boss; and children of real-life Sudanese refugees Peterdeng Mongok, Okwar Jale, Thon Kueth, Beng Ajuet and Kejo Jale as the younger lost boys.\n\nFalardeau directs from a screenplay by Margaret Nagle (HBO's \"Boardwalk Empire\").

De Niro and Stallone play Billy \"The Kid\" McDonnen and Henry \"Razor\" Sharp, two local Pittsburgh fighters whose fierce rivalry put them in the national spotlight. Each had scored a victory against the other during their heyday, but in 1983, on the eve of their decisive third match, Razor suddenly announced his retirement, refusing to explain why but effectively delivering a knock-out punch to both their careers. Thirty years later, boxing promoter Dante Slate Jr., seeing big dollar signs, makes them an offer they can't refuse: to re-enter the ring and settle the score once and for all. But they may not have to wait that long: on their first encounter in decades, their long-festering feud erupts into an unintentionally hilarious melee that instantly goes viral. The sudden social media frenzy transforms their local grudge match into a must-see HBO event.

As Nick bears witness, within and without the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles."}, {"Title": "Argo - Now Playing Spot 7", "Published_date": "2012-10-15T18:42:57Z", "Views": "3094", "Likes": "13", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "0", "Description": "http://argothemovie.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/argomovie\nNow playing in theaters nationwide.\nBased on real events, the dramatic thriller \"Argo\" chronicles the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis, focusing on the little-known role that the CIA and Hollywood played\u2014information that was not declassified until many years after the event.

Spin the wheels of your imagination and start building!\n\nSubmit a photo of your very own original LEGO vehicle for the chance to win $1,000 and see your design in action in LEGO: The Motion Picture.\n\nFrom your mind to the movie -- dream it, build it, share it and win!\n\nVisit www.legothemotionpicture.com for contest details."}, {"Title": "The Apparition - Now Playing Spot 3", "Published_date": "2012-08-24T17:05:48Z", "Views": "2247", "Likes": "12", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "3", "Description": "http://theapparition.warnerbros.com/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/theapparition\nIn the supernatural thriller THE APPARITION, Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) discover they are being haunted by a presence accidentally conjured during a university parapsychology experiment.

But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet\u2014or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets.

There is a new criminal mastermind at large--Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris)--and not only is he Holmes' intellectual equal, but his capacity for evil, coupled with a complete lack of conscience, may actually give him an advantage over the renowned detective. When the Crown Prince of Austria is found dead, the evidence, as construed by Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan), points to suicide. But Sherlock Holmes deduces that the prince has been the victim of murder--a murder that is only one piece of a larger and much more portentous puzzle, designed by one Professor Moriarty. Mixing business with pleasure, Holmes tracks the clues to an underground gentlemen's club, where he and his brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) are toasting Dr. Watson on his last night of bachelorhood. It is there that Holmes encounters Sim (Noomi Rapace), a Gypsy fortune teller, who sees more than she is telling and whose unwitting involvement in the prince's murder makes her the killer's next target. Holmes barely manages to save her life and, in return, she reluctantly agrees to help him. The investigation becomes ever more dangerous as it leads Holmes, Watson and Sim across the continent, from England to France to Germany and finally to Switzerland. But the cunning Moriarty is always one step ahead as he spins a web of death and destruction--all part of a greater plan that, if he succeeds, will change the course of history. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie returns to direct \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,\" the follow-up to the smash hit \"Sherlock Holmes.\" The sequel also reunites producers Joel Silver, Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey and Dan Lin. Bruce Berman serves as executive producer, with Steve Clark-Hall co-producing. Jared Harris (TV's \"Mad Men,\" \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\") joins the cast as the notorious Professor Moriarty. Also joining the cast, in her first English-speaking role, is Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, who gained international attention in the Swedish film \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\" Stephen Fry (\"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\") plays Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's older brother. Additional cast members returning from the first film include Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade; Kelly Reilly as Watson's bride, Mary Morstan; and Geraldine James as Holmes's long-suffering landlady, Mrs. Hudson. \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" is written by Michele Mulroney & Kieran Mulroney. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were created by the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and appear in stories and novels by him."}, {"Title": "Crazy, Stupid, Love. - TV Spot #11", "Published_date": "2011-07-13T16:44:50Z", "Views": "275359", "Likes": "202", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "43", "Description": "http://www.crazystupidlovemovie.com\n\nAt fortysomething, straight-laced Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is living the dream--good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high school sweetheart.

Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to survive.

Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal.

Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls--the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the fiercely loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and the reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish)--to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm). Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn), their unbelievable journey--if they succeed--will set them free."}, {"Title": "Yogi Bear - TV Spot #9", "Published_date": "2010-12-11T01:02:28Z", "Views": "47729", "Likes": "87", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "6", "Description": "http://www.yogibear.com\n\nEveryone's favorite pic-a-nic basket-stealing bear comes to the big screen in \"Yogi Bear.\" Jellystone Park has been losing business, so greedy Mayor Brown decides to shut it down and sell the land.

But when a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy the balance of power in the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth lie in the hands of their newest recruit, the first human ever selected: Hal Jordan. Hal is a gifted and cocky test pilot, but the Green Lanterns have little respect for humans, who have never harnessed the infinite powers of the ring before. But Hal is clearly the missing piece to the puzzle, and along with his determination and willpower, he has one thing no member of the Corps has ever had: humanity. With the encouragement of fellow pilot and childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), if Hal can quickly master his new powers and find the courage to overcome his fears, he may prove to be not only the key to defeating Parallax...he will become the greatest Green Lantern of all."}, {"Title": "Red Riding Hood - Trailer", "Published_date": "2010-11-16T23:22:46Z", "Views": "840670", "Likes": "2636", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "218", "Description": "http://www.redridinghoodmovie.com\r\n\r\nIn \"Red Riding Hood,\" Seyfried plays Valerie, a beautiful young woman torn between two men.

For years, the people have maintained an uneasy truce with the beast, offering the creature a monthly animal sacrifice. But under a blood red moon, the wolf has upped the stakes by taking a human life. Hungry for revenge, the people call on famed werewolf hunter, Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), to help them kill the wolf. But Solomon's arrival brings unintended consequences as he warns that the wolf, who takes human form by day, could be any one of them.

On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale--the legend of the Deathly \r\n\r\nHallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became \"the Boy Who Lived.\" No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort."}, {"Title": "The Town - TV Spot #7", "Published_date": "2010-09-02T18:10:34Z", "Views": "24285", "Likes": "52", "Favorite": "0", "Comments": "6", "Description": "http://www.thetownmovie.com\r\n\r\nDoug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is an unrepentant criminal, the de facto leader of a group of ruthless bank robbers who pride themselves in stealing what they want and getting out clean.
